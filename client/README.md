# Share2Win

Base project for Angular 2 apps, using Gulp to automate tasks and SystemJS to bundle the app.

## Usage

Install the npm packages with `npm i`. You may also need to run `gem install scss-lint` for the linter to work.

To generate the output directory `dist/` run the command `gulp`.

If you add more `@angular` packages, you will need to update the `system.config.js` file to include them in the bundle during the build process.

## Tests

Tests are in the `test` directory, with one already there as an example. To run the tests, use the command `gulp test`. This generates the JavaScript files, then runs the tests against them.

You can have the tests auto-run when tests or ts files change by running the `gulp watchtests` command.

## Production

For a production setup, uncomment the lines in `main.ts` to put Angular in production mode. Then, run the minification task to minify vendor files `gulp minify`.

## Auto-Refresh when Developing

You may run `gulp watch` in a stand-alone terminal to have the output automatically updated when you save changes.
